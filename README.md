# Social Feed iOS App 📱

## Overview
The goal of this project was to create a **simplified social media feed app** to demonstrate my iOS development skills.  
The challenge was to build an app that fetches posts from a server, stores data locally, and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

---

## Problem
- Users need a simple way to view posts in a feed  
- Offline support is required for data persistence  
- Networking and API calls need to be efficient and reliable  

---

## Solution
I developed this iOS app using **Swift, UIKit, CoreData, and Alamofire**, which:  
- Fetches posts from a remote API using **Alamofire**  
- Stores posts locally with **CoreData** for offline access  
- Displays posts in a **clean and scrollable feed**  
- Supports **pull-to-refresh** for real-time updates  
- Uses **MVC architecture** for clean and maintainable code  

---

## Result
- Fully functional iOS social feed app  
- Smooth and responsive UI  
- Offline support ensures users can view posts without internet  
- Demonstrates understanding of **networking, data persistence, and UIKit**  

---

## Tech Stack
- Swift & UIKit  
- Alamofire for network requests  
- CoreData for local storage  
- MVC Architecture  
- Git & Version Control
